I’m an IT & Security Analyst with hands-on experience in server setup, system administration, and security operations. My work focuses on building reliable infrastructure and securing it using industry best practices.

I enjoy designing and implementing secure systems — from Linux and Windows servers to web and API-based applications — with a strong emphasis on hardening, monitoring, and governance.

I hold the CompTIA Security+ certification and I’m actively building security-focused technical solutions and homelabs.
